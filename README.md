Hey, I’m Asma 👋

Cybersecurity student who likes building things instead of just talking about attacks.
I work mostly on secure backend systems, security-related data, and Flutter apps that sit on top of real APIs.

Based in Algeria 🇩🇿

---

### What I’m into
- Designing secure authentication and authorization flows
- Analyzing logs and security signals to find suspicious behavior
- Turning backend systems into usable mobile apps
- Learning how real systems fail — and how to harden them

---

### Tools I actually use

**⚡ Backend**
Python · Django · Node.js · PostgreSQL · REST APIs  

**☁️ Security**
JWT · OAuth2 · Hashing · Input validation · Access control  

**🗄️ Databases**
PostgreSQL · MongoDB · MySQL · Supabase · Drizzle · Firebase

**📱Mobile**
Flutter · Dart  

**🛠️ Tools**
Git · GitHub · Postman · Arduino · Cisco
---

### Things I’ve built (or I’m building)
- **Secure Auth API** — role-based access control, JWT, logging, rate limiting  
- **Security Log Analyzer** — detects unusual patterns in authentication and system logs  
- **Flutter Security Dashboard** — mobile client for monitoring security data  
- **Phishing Email Detector** — ML-based experiment using real-world datasets  

Each project is built for learning and defensive security purposes.

---

### Currently improving
- Backend security patterns
- Security analytics
- Applying ML carefully in cybersecurity (no hype, just signals)

🤝 If you’re into secure systems, backend work, or security data — we’ll get along.
